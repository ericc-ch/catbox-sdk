# Catbox Tools

## API

The API is located at https://catbox.moe/user/api.php

There are 8 different "request types" that are valid to the Catbox API. 3 of them are for files, the other 5 are for albums.

Italicized arguments are optional. Obviously the actual order of the variables doesn't matter, but for sensiblity you should keep them as so.

File uploads

Note: for anonymous uploads, simply don't supply a userhash.

**File Uploads**

`reqtype="fileupload" _userhash="####"_ fileToUpload=(file data here)`

**URL Uploads**

`reqtype="urlupload" _userhash="####"_ url="http://i.imgur.com/aksF5Gk.jpg"`

Deleting Files

**Deleting Files**

`reqtype="deletefiles" userhash="####" files="eh871k.png d9pove.gif"`

Album Management

For an anonymous album, don't give a userhash. Albums created anonymously CANNOT be edited or deleted.

Albums are currently limited to 500 files. This may be removed in the future.

**Creating an album**

`reqtype="createalbum" userhash="####" title="Title Here" _desc="Description Here"_ files="8ce67f.jpg f51d7d.jpg 65ea43.jpg"`

The files argument should be SINGLE SPACE SEPARATED FILES which exist on Catbox.

Duplicate file entries in the file argument will be removed, but please don't do that anyway.

**Editing an album**

`reqtype="editalbum" userhash="####" short="pd412w" title="Title Here" desc="Description Here" files="8ce67f.jpg f51d7d.jpg 65ea43.jpg"`

**EDITALBUM IS A VERY POWERFUL REQUEST TYPE. You MUST supply every argument, or else it will be taken as "". Think of it as a direct input.**

The "short" is the 6 alphanumeric characters in the url that's generated.

If you want to easily add or remove files, use the following two request types.

**Adding files to an album**

`reqtype="addtoalbum" userhash="####" short="pd412w" files="8ce67f.jpg f51d7d.jpg 65ea43.jpg"`

**Removing files from an album**

`reqtype="removefromalbum" userhash="####" short="pd412w" files="8ce67f.jpg f51d7d.jpg 65ea43.jpg"`

**Deleting an album**

`reqtype="deletealbum" userhash="####" short="pd412w"`

cURL to API

If you want to make curl requests to the API, here are examples of both.

`curl -F "reqtype=urlupload" -F "userhash=####" -F "url=https://files.catbox.moe/174bac.jpg" https://catbox.moe/user/api.php`

`curl -F "reqtype=fileupload" -F "userhash=####" -F "fileToUpload=@cutie.png" https://catbox.moe/user/api.php`
